# Inception Project - 1337 Coding School

## Overview

The Inception project is part of the curriculum at 1337 Coding School, designed to help students build foundational knowledge of Linux, containerization (with Docker), networking, and system administration. This project challenges students to set up and configure various systems, services, and applications to run together in a cohesive environment. The goal is to simulate a real-world system infrastructure to ensure that students gain hands-on experience with key technologies used in modern software development and deployment.

## Project Objectives

The goal of the Inception project is to:

- Set up a virtualized environment using Docker and Docker Compose.
- Configure and deploy multiple services (web server, database, etc.) within containers.
- Establish communication between the containers and configure networking settings.
- Demonstrate proper use of version control (Git) and the command line interface (CLI).
- Apply Linux commands for system administration and troubleshooting.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Docker**: For containerization and orchestrating multiple services.
- **Docker Compose**: For defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
- **Nginx**: As a web server.
- **MySQL**: As the database system.
- **PHP**: For building dynamic web applications.
- **Git**: For version control.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Inception project, you'll need to have the following software installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Ensure that you have a basic understanding of Docker, Git, and Linux commands to successfully complete the project.
